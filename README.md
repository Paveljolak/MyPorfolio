This will be my portfolio website. Where I will share links to my latest projects, and maybe some other stuff aswell.

I have followed ths tutorial to make it: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/build-portfolio-website-react/

I will probably change bunch of things when I have more time. But for now I am just happy I made it run.
